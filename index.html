    <p> My roommate is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until he lived in my apartment. 
    When he was just a few feet away. When I could talk to him almost any time I wanted.
    But then I remebered he liked listening to music. Now he does it all the time. It's hard to have a conversation
    with him when he's listening to "Swans" or that other band that sounds really scary. I just wish we could talk about stuff we 
    used to, like books and philosophy. And now I have to listen to him listen to stuff and it's kind of boring. This is the end of the bit.</p>
